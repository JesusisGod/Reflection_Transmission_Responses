# Reflection_Transmission_Responses
The code Seismic_UpDownGoing.m is central to the algorithm presented in the manuscript: Algorithm for accurate velocity analysis of 1D acoustic reflection and transmission responses by projection constrained multi-physics inversion.

Seismic_UpDownGoing.m is used to compute the reflection and transmission responses from a 1D acoustically layered velocity model. An impulse source has been assumed. However, users can convolve choice source function (e.g. Ricker wavelet) with the output from Seismic_UpDownGoing.m.

The algorithm in the manuscript has been detailed and can be implemented, with the appropriate inclusion of the forward code, Seismic_UpDownGoing.m.
